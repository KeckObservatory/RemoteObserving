## Firewall Connection Info:
##   If you are outside of the Keck network and need to authenticate through the
##   Keck firewall, fill out the appropriate IP address, port, and username
##   which will be used to authenticate. If this is being run inside of the
##   Keck network, comment out these lines.
firewall_address: ???.???.???.???
firewall_port: ???
firewall_user: ???


## SSH Key Info:
##   SSH private key file path.  You should have created an ssh public/private
##   key pair and provided the public key to Keck, enter the path for the
##   private key here.
ssh_pkey: '~/.ssh/id_rsa'


## VNC Viewer Command:
##   This is the command to invoke on the local machine to launch a VNC client
##   Command will be formatted as [vncviewer] [vncargs] [address]:[port]
##   If you have configured your VNC viewer application to use a vncpasswd file
##   (generated by the vncpasswd command), add the --passwd argument to
##   vncargs below, e.g.: '-passwd=/home/observer/.vnc/passwd'
##
##   Example: TigerVnC (linux)
vncviewer: 'vncviewer'
vncprefix: ''
vncargs: '-Shared -FullColor -PreferredEncoding=ZRLE -AutoSelect=0'
##
##   Example: TigerVNC (macOS)
#vncviewer: '/Applications/TigerVNC Viewer 1.10.1.app/Contents/MacOS/TigerVNC Viewer'
#vncprefix: ''
#vncargs: '-Shared -FullColor'
##
##   Example: RealVNC (macOS)
#vncviewer: '/Applications/VNC Viewer.app/Contents/MacOS/vncviewer'
#vncprefix: ''
#vncargs: '-Shared'
##
##   Example: Built in Screen Sharing app in macOS:
#vncviewer: 'open'
#vncprefix: 'vnc://'
#vncargs: ''


## Soundplay Configuration:
##   The soundplayer application included in this software receives the signal
##   to play a sound from the Keck systems.  This is a compiled package, so it
##   needs to be paired to your system.  The default value is a symbolic link
##   which you can point to another executable if you prefer that method of
##   specifying it (see ./soundplayer/ folder).
##
##   aplay is he path to the command-line sound player. Defaults to 'aplay'.
##
##   Example: linux
soundplayer: 'soundplay'
aplay: '/usr/bin/aplay'
##
##   Example: macOS
##   If using the afplay executable on macOS, you may override the volume level
##   set in the eventsounds software (running on the instrument server) by
##   changing the value after -v to something between 1 and 100.  To lower it,
##   put in a small value (e.g. 1).  The %v value means it will use the volume
##   slider on eventsounds.
#soundplayer: 'soundplay.darwin.x86_64'
#aplay: '/usr/bin/afplay -v %v %s'


## Default sessions ito start if not specified on command line.
default_sessions: ['control0', 'control1', 'control2', 'telstatus']


## For ssh tunnelling, a starting local port number is used and incremented for
## each port as needed.  Default is 5901.
#local_port_start: 5901


## Window size and positioning configs. Overrides calculated values.
#window_size: [1280, 800]
#window_positions: [[0, 0], [1280, 0], [0, 1280], [1280, 0]]


## If the firewall authentication has been performed, should the script
## de-authenticate when it exits? This is generally not required; the firewall
## authorization will automatically expire after 24 hours. Set this option to
## True to close the firewall hole when the script exits.
firewall_cleanup: False
