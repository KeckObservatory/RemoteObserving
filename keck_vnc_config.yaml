  ## If you are outside of the Keck network and need to authenticate through the
  ## Keck firewall, uncomment and fill out the appropriate IP address, port, and

  # firewall_user: 'sshuser',

  ## When first connecting to Keck to determine which VNC server to connect to
  ## (i.e. where to run `kvncinfo -server`) this is the list of computers to try
  servers_to_try: ['svncserver1', 'kcwi', 'svncserver2', 'mosfire'],

  ## This is the command to invoke on the local machine to launch a VNC client
  ## Command will be formatted as [vncviewer] [vncargs] [address]:[port]
  vncviewer: 'vncviewer',
  vncprefix: '',
  vncargs: '',
  ## Example: use VNCviewer for RealVNC vncviewer on macOS
  # vncviewer: '/Applications/VNC Viewer.app/Contents/MacOS/vncviewer',
  # vncprefix: '',
  # vncargs: '',
  ## Example: use built in Screen Sharing app in macOS:
  # vncviewer: 'open',
  # vncprefix: 'vnc://',
  # vncargs: '',
  ## Example using vncpasswd file
  # vncargs: '-passwd=/home/observer/.vnc/passwd',

  ## Always use these local ports:
  # local_ports: [5911, 5912, 5913, 5914, 5915, 5916, 5917, 5918, 5919],

  ## Soundplay configs
  ## Name of soundplayer executable to use (see ./soundplayer/ folder)
  # soundplayer: 'soundplay-8.5.1-linux-x86_64'
  ## Path to "aplay" on local computer for command-line sound player.  Default assumed in path as 'aplay'
  # aplay: '/usr/bin/aplay',

  ## Window size and positioning configs. Overrides calculated size and/or positioning.
  # window_size: [1280, 800],
  # window_positions: [[0, 0], [1280, 0], [0, 1280], [1280, 0]],
